## Disclaimer

The content of these slides is a modified/adapted version of Twitter's Scala School project: http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/

Twitter is commited to training their new hires in Scala and we think that's cool. We also think that Scala is cool and we want you to think that as well.

Anyways, so credits goes to the guys at Twitter for building this material.

## Scala at Hopper
At hopper, we're building the largest structured database of travel information. We tackle complex problems at large scales so we like to have the right tools so we can focus on those problems.

* Started being used in 2011, only marginally/informally
* Became 50/50 (with Java) in 2012
* Hopper is officially a "Scala shop" in 2013
  * 100% of our new backend code is Scala
  * Java code being replaced as we replace components

We've replaced several complex core components. Everytime, the process cut down the amount of code by at least half.
</section>

<section class="slide">
## Scala at Hopper

Today, we use Scala everywhere

* Hadoop M/R
* Storm
* RPC services
* Web frontend tools (not the actual Web Application though)
* Data Analytics
* anywhere we can!

## About this class

The first session will cover basics: syntax and concepts. The second session will be more hands-on.

Today, we encourage you to follow along with your own interpreter so you can explore things on your own.

</section><section class="slide">

## Why Scala?

* Expressive
    * First-class functions and closures
* Concise
    * Type inference
    * Literal syntax for function creation
* Java interoperability
    * Can reuse java libraries and tools
    * No performance penalty
    * benefits from 15 years of JVM development and optimization

## What Scala?

Scala is a `sca`lable `la`nguage. It can scale as you need it to. This is Scala:

    class Hello {

      def greet(name : String) {
        println("Hi there " + name)
      }
    }

## Think Scala

Although Scala is simply a jar file on your classpath, it is not just a library or a nicer/cleaner Java. It is its own language that happens to be compatible with all the java ecosystem. To properly learn Scala, approach it with a fresh mind.

</section><section class="slide">

## Start the Interpreter

Start the included `sbt console`.


    $ sbt console

    [...]

    Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
    Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
    Type :help for more information.

    scala>


</section><section class="slide">

## Expressions

    scala> 1 + 1
    res0: Int = 2

```res0``` is an automatically created value name given by the interpreter to the result of your expression.  It has the type Int and contains the Integer 2.

(Almost) everything in Scala is an expression.

</section><section class="slide">

## Values

You can give the result of an expression a name.

    scala> val two = 1 + 1
    two: Int = 2

You cannot change the binding to a val.

    scala> two = 2
    &lt;console>:8: error: reassignment to val
           two = 2
</section><section class="slide">

## Variables

If you need to change the binding, you can use a `var` instead.

    scala> var name = "steve"
    name: java.lang.String = steve

    scala> name = "marius"
    name: java.lang.String = marius

`var` is rarely used in idiomatic Scala.

</section><section class="slide">

## Equality

Scala  has both reference and value equality.

    scala> val foo = new String("foobar")
    foo: java.lang.String = foobar

    scala> val bar = new String("foobar")
    bar: java.lang.String = foobar

    scala> foo == bar
    res9: Boolean = true

    scala> foo.eq(bar)
    res10: Boolean = false

</section><section class="slide">

## Functions

You can create functions with def.

    scala> def addOne(m: Int): Int = m + 1
    addOne: (m: Int)Int

In Scala, you need to specify the type signature for function parameters.  The interpreter happily repeats the type signature back to you.

    scala> val three = addOne(2)
    three: Int = 3

</section><section class="slide">

## Zero-Argument Functions 

You can leave off parens on functions with no arguments.

    scala> def three() = 1 + 2
    three: ()Int

    scala> three()
    res2: Int = 3

    scala> three
    res3: Int = 3

</section><section class="slide">

## Anonymous Functions

You can create anonymous functions.

    scala> (x: Int) => x + 1
    res2: (Int) => Int = &lt;function1>

    scala> res2(1)
    res3: Int = 2

You can pass anonymous functions around or save them into vals.

    scala> val addOne = (x: Int) => x + 1
    addOne: (Int) => Int = &lt;function1>

    scala> addOne(1)
    res4: Int = 2

</section><section class="slide">

## Multi-expression Functions

If your function is made up of many expressions, you can use {} to give yourself some breathing room.

    def timesTwo(i: Int): Int = {
      println("hello world")
      i * 2
    }

This is also true of an anonymous function.

    scala> { i: Int =>
      println("hello world")
      i * 2
    }
    res0: (Int) => Int = &lt;function1&gt;

You will see this syntax often used when passing an anonymous function as an argument.

</section><section class="slide">

## Partial application

You can partially apply a function with an underscore, which gives you another function. Scala uses the underscore to mean different things in different contexts, but you can usually think of it as an unnamed magical wildcard. In the context of `{ _ + 2 }` it means an unnamed parameter. You can use it like so:

    scala> def adder(m: Int, n: Int) = m + n
    adder: (m: Int,n: Int)Int

    scala> val add2 = adder(2, _:Int)
    add2: (Int) => Int = &lt;function1&gt;

    scala> add2(3)
    res50: Int = 5

You can partially apply any argument in the argument list, not just the last one.

</section><section class="slide">

## Curried functions

Sometimes it makes sense to let people apply some arguments to your function now and others later.

Here's an example of a function with multiple argument lists:

    scala> def multiply(m: Int)(n: Int): Int = m * n
    multiply: (m: Int)(n: Int)Int

You can call it directly with both arguments, or fill in the first and then the second.

    scala> multiply(2)(3)
    res0: Int = 6

    scala> val timesTwo = multiply(2) _
    timesTwo: (Int) => Int = &lt;function1&gt;

    scala> timesTwo(3)
    res1: Int = 6

</section><section class="slide">

## Variable length arguments

There is a special syntax for methods that can take parameters of a repeated type. To apply String's `capitalize` function to several strings, you might write:

    def capitalizeAll(args: String*) = {
      args.map { arg =>
        arg.capitalize
      }
    }

    scala> capitalizeAll("rarity", "applejack")
    res2: Seq[String] = ArrayBuffer(Rarity, Applejack)

</section><section class="slide">

## Classes

    scala> class Calculator {
         |   val brand: String = "HP"
         |   def add(m: Int, n: Int): Int = m + n
         | }
    defined class Calculator

    scala> val calc = new Calculator
    calc: Calculator = Calculator@e75a11

    scala> calc.add(1, 2)
    res1: Int = 3

    scala> calc.brand
    res2: String = "HP"

Contained are examples are defining methods with def and fields with val.  Methods are just functions that can access the state of the class.

</section><section class="slide">

## Constructor

Constructors aren't special methods, they are the code outside of method definitions in your class.  Let's extend our Calculator example to take a constructor argument and use it to initialize internal state.

    class Calculator(brand: String) {

    val color: String = 
      if (brand == "TI") "blue"
      else if (brand == "HP") "black"
      else "white"

      def add(m: Int, n: Int): Int = m + n
    }

Use the `new` keyword to construct an instance:

    scala> val calc = new Calculator("HP")
    calc: Calculator = Calculator@1e64cc4d

    scala> calc.color
    res0: String = black

</section><section class="slide">

## Expressions

Our BasicCalculator example gave an example of how Scala is expression-oriented.  The value color was bound based on an if/else expression. Scala is highly expression-oriented: most things are expressions rather than statements.

    scala> val notation = if(calc.color == "black") "reverse polish" else "infix"
	notation : java.lang.String = "reverse polish"

</section><section class="slide">

## Inheritance

    class ScientificCalculator(brand: String) extends Calculator(brand) {
      def log(m: Double, base: Double) = {
        math.log(m) / math.log(base)
      }
    }

</section><section class="slide">

## Overloading methods

    class EvenMoreScientificCalculator(brand: String) extends ScientificCalculator(brand) {
      def log(m: Int): Double = log(m, math.exp(1))
    }

</section><section class="slide">

## Abstract Classes

You can define an `abstract class`, a class that defines some methods but does not implement them. Instead, subclasses that extend the abstract class define these methods. You can't create an instance of an abstract class.

    scala> abstract class Shape {
         |   def getArea():Int    // subclass should define this
         | }
    defined class Shape

    scala> class Circle(r: Int) extends Shape {
         |   def getArea():Int = { r * r * 3 }
         | }
    defined class Circle

    scala> val s = new Shape
    &lt;console&gt;:8: error: class Shape is abstract; cannot be instantiated
           val s = new Shape
               ^

    scala> val c = new Circle(2)
    c: Circle = Circle@65c0035b

</section><section class="slide">

## Traits

`trait`s are collections of fields and behaviors that you can extend or mixin to your classes.

    trait Car {
      val brand: String
    }

    trait Shiny {
      val shineRefraction: Int

	  def computeShinyness(light: Double) = {
	    shineRefraction * light
	  }
    }

    class BMW extends Car {
      val brand = "BMW"
    }

One class can extend several traits using the `with` keyword:

    class BMW extends Car with Shiny {
      val brand = "BMW"
      val shineRefraction = 12
    }
</section><section class="slide">

## Type Parameters

Earlier, you saw that we defined a function that took an `Int` which is a type of Number. Functions can also be generic and work on any type. When that occurs, you'll see a type parameter introduced with the square bracket syntax. Here's an example of a Cache of generic Keys and Values.

    trait Cache[K, V] {
      def get(key: K): V
      def put(key: K, value: V)
      def delete(key: K)
    }

Methods can also have type parameters introduced.

    def remove[K](key: K)

</section><section class="slide">

## apply methods

apply methods give you a nice syntactic sugar for when a class has one main use.

    scala> class Bar {
         |   def apply() = 0
         | }
    defined class Bar
    
    scala> val bar = new Bar
    bar: Bar = Bar@47711479
    
    scala> bar()
    res8: Int = 0

Here our instance object looks like we're calling a function. More on that later!

</section><section class="slide">

## Functions are Objects

In Scala, functions are represented by a set of traits: `Function0` through `Function22`.

    val double = new Function1[Int, Int] {
      def apply(x: Int): Int = x * 2
    }

is equivalent to

    val double = { x: Int => x * 2} 
	
For the ones that noticed, the interpreter already told you that:

    scala> val double = { x : Int => x * 2}
    double: Int => Int = &lt;function1&gt;

</section><section class="slide">

## Objects

Objects are like classes, but with a single instance. Often used for 'static' values.

    object Constants {
      val Pi = 3.14 // Close enough
    }

Classes and Objects can have the same name.  The object is called a 'Companion Object'.  We commonly use Companion Objects for Factories. Here is a trivial example that only serves to remove the need to use 'new' to create an instance.

    class Bar(foo: String)
    
    object Bar {
      def apply(foo: String) = new Bar(foo)
    }


</section><section class="slide">

## Packages

You can organize your code inside of packages.

    package com.twitter.example

    class ExampleClass

at the top of a file will declare everything in the file to be in that package. In another package, you'd need to `import` this class:

    import com.twitter.example.ExampleClass

You can import everything from a package by using the wildcard:

    import com.twitter.example._

You can rename symbols when importing into your local scope:

    import java.util.{List => UtilList}

</section><section class="slide">

## Package Objects

You can create an object for your package. These can be used to delcare anything (traits, classes, functions, etc.) It is often used to declare functions, constants and type definitions, because these cannot be declared out of "thin air": they need to be attached to an object.

    package com.twitter

    package object example {
	  val SomeConstant = 42

	  def theMeaningOfLifeTheUniverseAndEverything() = SomeConstant

	}
    
</section><section class="slide">

## Pattern Matching

One of the most useful parts of Scala. Matching on values:

    val times = 1
    
    times match {
      case 1 => "one"
      case 2 => "two"
      case _ => "some other number"
    }

The `_` in the last case statement is a wildcard; it matches everything. Otherwise, you will suffer a
runtime error if you pass in a number that doesn't match.

</section><section class="slide">

## Matching with Guards

    times match {
      case i if i == 1 => "one"
      case i if i == 2 => "two"
      case _ => "some other number"
    }

Notice how we captured the value in the variable 'i'.

</section><section class="slide">

## Matching on type

You can use `match` to handle values of different types differently.

    def bigger(o: Any): Any = o match {
      case i: Int if i < 0 => i - 1
      case i: Int => i + 1
      case d: Double if d < 0.0 => d - 0.1
      case d: Double => d + 0.1
      case text: String => text + "s"
    }

</section><section class="slide">

## Matching on class members

Remember our calculator from earlier? Let's classify them according to type. Here's the painful way first:

    def calcType(calc: Calculator) = calc match {
      case _ if calc.brand == "hp" && calc.model == "20B" => "financial"
      case _ if calc.brand == "hp" && calc.model == "48G" => "scientific"
      case _ if calc.brand == "hp" && calc.model == "30B" => "business"
      case _ => "unknown"
    }

Wow, that's painful.  Thankfully Scala provides some nice tools specifically for this.

</section><section class="slide">

## Case Classes

case classes are used to conveniently store and match on the contents of a class. You can construct them without using new.

    scala> case class Calculator(brand: String, model: String)
    defined class Calculator
    
    scala> val hp20b = Calculator("hp", "20b")
    hp20b: Calculator = Calculator(hp,20b)

case classes automatically have equality and nice toString methods based on the constructor arguments.

    scala> val hp20b = Calculator("hp", "20b")
    hp20b: Calculator = Calculator(hp,20b)
    
    scala> val hp20B = Calculator("hp", "20b")
    hp20B: Calculator = Calculator(hp,20b)
    
    scala> hp20b == hp20B
    res6: Boolean = true

case classes can have methods just like normal classes.

</section><section class="slide">

## Case Classes with pattern matching

case classes are designed to be used with pattern matching.  Let's simplify our calculator classifier example from earlier.

    val hp20b = Calculator("hp", "20B")
    val hp30b = Calculator("hp", "30B")
    
    def calcType(calc: Calculator) = calc match {
      case Calculator("hp", "20B") => "financial"
      case Calculator("hp", "48G") => "scientific"
      case Calculator("hp", "30B") => "business"
      case Calculator(ourBrand, ourModel) => "Calculator: %s %s is of unknown type".format(ourBrand, ourModel)
    }

Other alternatives for that last match

      case Calculator(_, _) => "Calculator of unknown type"

  OR we could simply not specify that it's a Calculator at all.

      case _ => "Calculator of unknown type"

  OR we could re-bind the matched value with another name

      case c@Calculator(_, _) => "Calculator: %s of unknown type".format(c)

</section><section class="slide">
## Exceptions

Exceptions are available in Scala via a try-catch-finally syntax that uses pattern matching.

    try {
      remoteCalculatorService.add(1, 2)
    } catch {
      case e: ServerIsDownException => log.error(e, "the remote calculator service is unavailable.")
    } finally {
      remoteCalculatorService.close()
    }

</section><section class="slide">
## Exceptions (contd)
`try`s are also expression-oriented

    val result: Int = try {
      remoteCalculatorService.add(1, 2)
    } catch {
      case e: ServerIsDownException => {
        log.error(e, "the remote calculator service is unavailable.")
        0
      }
    } finally {
      remoteCalculatorService.close()
    }

This is not an example of excellent programming style, just an example of try-catch-finally resulting in expressions like most everything else in Scala.

Finally will be called after an exception has been handled and is not part of the expression.

Scala has no concept of checked-exceptions: you are never required to surround a method with a try-catch block.

</section><section class="slide">

# Collections

</section><section class="slide">

## `List`

    scala> val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
    numbers: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

</section><section class="slide">

## `Set`

Sets have no duplicates

    scala> Set(1, 1, 2)
    res0: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(1, 2)

</section><section class="slide">

## Tuple

A tuple groups together simple logical collections of items without using a class.

    scala> val hostPort = ("localhost", 80)
    hostPort: (String, Int) = (localhost, 80)

They have accessors that are named by their position (which is 1-based rather than 0-based).

    scala> hostPort._1
    res0: String = localhost
    
    scala> hostPort._2
    res1: Int = 80

Tuples fit with pattern matching nicely.

    hostPort match {
      case ("localhost", port) => ...
      case (host, port) => ...
    }

Tuple has some special sauce for simply making Tuples of 2 values: `->`

    scala> 1 -> 2
    res0: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

</section><section class="slide">

## `Map`

It can hold basic datatypes.

    Map(1 -> 2)
    Map("foo" -> "bar")

This looks like special syntax but remember back to our discussion of Tuple that `->` can be use to create Tuples.

`Map()` also uses that variable argument syntax we learned back in Lesson #1: `Map(1 -> "one", 2 -> "two")` which expands into `Map((1, "one"), (2, "two"))` with the first element being the key and the second being the value of the Map.

Maps can themselves contain Maps or even functions as values.

    Map(1 -> Map("foo" -> "bar"))

    Map("timesTwo" -> { timesTwo(_) })

</section><section class="slide">

## `Option`

`Option` is a container that may or may not hold something.

The basic interface for Option looks like:

    trait Option[T] {
      def isDefined: Boolean
      def get: T
      def getOrElse(t: T): T
    }

`Option` itself is generic and has two subclasses: `Some[T]` or `None`

Let's look at an example of how Option is used:

`Map.get` uses `Option` for its return type. Option tells you that the method might not return what you're asking for.

    scala> val numbers = Map(1 -> "one", 2 -> "two")
    numbers: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,String] = Map((1,one), (2,two))
    
    scala> numbers.get(2)
    res0: Option[java.lang.String] = Some(two)
    
    scala> numbers.get(3)
    res1: Option[java.lang.String] = None

Now our data appears trapped in this `Option`. How do we work with it?

</section><section class="slide">

## `Option` (contd)

A first instinct might be to do something conditionally based on the `isDefined` method.

    // We want to multiply the number by two, otherwise return 0.
    val result = if (res1.isDefined) {
      res1.get * 2
    } else {
      0
    }

We would suggest that you use either `getOrElse` or pattern matching to work with this result.

`getOrElse` lets you easily define a default value.

    val result = res1.getOrElse(0) * 2

Pattern matching fits naturally with `Option`.

    val result = res1 match {
      case Some(n) => n * 2
      case None => 0
    }

## Functional Combinators

`List(1, 2, 3) map squared` applies the function `squared` to the elements of the the list, returning a new list, perhaps `List(1, 4, 9)`. We call operations like `map` <em>combinators</em>. (If you'd like a better definition, you might like [Explanation of combinators](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7533837/explanation-of-combinators-for-the-working-man) on Stackoverflow.) Their most common use is on the standard data structures.

</section><section class="slide">

## `map`

Evaluates a function over each element in the list, returning a list with the same number of elements.

    scala> numbers.map((i: Int) => i * 2)
    res0: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8)

or pass in a partially evaluated function

    scala> def timesTwo(i: Int): Int = i * 2
    timesTwo: (i: Int)Int
    
    scala> numbers.map(timesTwo _)
    res0: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8)

</section><section class="slide">

## `foreach`

`foreach` is like map but returns nothing. It is intended for side-effects only.

    scala> numbers.foreach((i: Int) => i * 2)

returns nothing.

You can try to store the return in a value but it'll be of type Unit (i.e. void)

    scala> val doubled = numbers.foreach((i: Int) => i * 2)
    doubled: Unit = ()

</section><section class="slide">

## `filter`

removes any elements where the function you pass in evaluates to false.  Functions that return a Boolean are often called predicate functions.

    scala> numbers.filter((i: Int) => i % 2 == 0)
    res0: List[Int] = List(2, 4)

    scala> def isEven(i: Int): Boolean = i % 2 == 0
    isEven: (i: Int)Boolean
    
    scala> numbers.filter(isEven _)
    res2: List[Int] = List(2, 4)

</section><section class="slide">

## `zip`

`zip` aggregates the contents of two lists into a single list of pairs.

    scala> List(1, 2, 3).zip(List("a", "b", "c"))
    res0: List[(Int, String)] = List((1,a), (2,b), (3,c))

</section><section class="slide">

## `partition`

`partition` splits a list based on where it falls with respect to a predicate function.

    scala> val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
    scala> val (even, odd) = numbers.partition { _ %2 == 0 }
    even: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
    odd: List[Int] = List(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))

</section><section class="slide">

## `find`

`find` returns the first element of a collection that matches a predicate function (as an `Option`).

    scala> numbers.find((i: Int) => i > 5)
    res0: Option[Int] = Some(6)

</section><section class="slide">

## `drop` & `dropWhile`

`drop` drops the first i elements

    scala> numbers.drop(5)
    res0: List[Int] = List(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

`dropWhile` removes the first elements that match a predicate function. For example, if we `dropWhile` odd numbers from our list of numbers, `1` gets dropped (but not `3` which is "shielded" by `2`).

    scala> numbers.dropWhile(_ % 2 != 0)
    res0: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

</section><section class="slide">

## `foldLeft`

    scala> numbers.foldLeft(0)((m: Int, n: Int) => m + n)
    res0: Int = 55

0 is the starting value (Remember that numbers is a `List[Int]`), and m
acts as an accumulator.

Seen visually:

    scala> numbers.foldLeft(0) { (m: Int, n: Int) => println("m: " + m + " n: " + n); m + n }
    m: 0 n: 1
    m: 1 n: 2
    m: 3 n: 3
    m: 6 n: 4
    m: 10 n: 5
    m: 15 n: 6
    m: 21 n: 7
    m: 28 n: 8
    m: 36 n: 9
    m: 45 n: 10
    res0: Int = 55

</section><section class="slide">

## `foldRight`

Is the same as `foldLeft` except it runs in the opposite direction.

    scala> numbers.foldRight(0) { (m: Int, n: Int) => println("m: " + m + " n: " + n); m + n }
    m: 10 n: 0
    m: 9 n: 10
    m: 8 n: 19
    m: 7 n: 27
    m: 6 n: 34
    m: 5 n: 40
    m: 4 n: 45
    m: 3 n: 49
    m: 2 n: 52
    m: 1 n: 54
    res0: Int = 55

</section><section class="slide">

## `flatten`

`flatten` collapses one level of nested structure.

    scala> List(List(1, 2), List(3, 4)).flatten
    res0: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

</section><section class="slide">

## `flatMap`

`flatMap` is a frequently used combinator that combines mapping and flattening. `flatMap` takes a function that works on the nested lists and then concatenates the results back together.

    scala> val nestedNumbers = List(List(1, 2), List(3, 4))
    nestedNumbers: List[List[Int]] = List(List(1, 2), List(3, 4))
    
    scala> nestedNumbers.flatMap(x => x.map(_ * 2))
    res0: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8)

Think of it as short-hand for mapping and then flattening:

    scala> nestedNumbers.map((x: List[Int]) => x.map(_ * 2)).flatten
    res1: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8)

that example calling map and then flatten is an example of the "combinator"-like nature of these functions.

*See Also* Effective Scala has opinions about [flatMap](http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/##Functional%20programming-`flatMap`).

</section><section class="slide">

## What about `Map`?

All of the functional combinators shown work on Maps, too. Maps can be thought of as a list of pairs so the functions you write work on a pair of the keys and values in the Map.

    scala> val extensions = Map("steve" -> 100, "bob" -> 101, "joe" -> 201)
    extensions: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map((steve,100), (bob,101), (joe,201))

Now filter out every entry whose phone extension is lower than 200.

    scala> extensions.filter((namePhone: (String, Int)) => namePhone._2 < 200)
    res0: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map((steve,100), (bob,101))

Because it gives you a tuple, you have to pull out the keys and values with their positional accessors. Yuck!

Lucky us, we can actually use a pattern match to extract the key and value nicely.

    scala> extensions.filter({case (name, extension) => extension < 200})
    res0: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int] = Map((steve,100), (bob,101))

</section><section class="slide">

## Function Composition

Let's make two aptly-named functions:

    scala> def f(s: String) = "f(" + s + ")"
    f: (String)java.lang.String
    
    scala> def g(s: String) = "g(" + s + ")"
    g: (String)java.lang.String

</section><section class="slide">

## `compose`

`compose` makes a new function that composes other functions `f(g(x))`

    scala> val fComposeG = f _ compose g _
    fComposeG: (String) => java.lang.String = &lt;function&gt;
    
    scala> fComposeG("yay")
    res0: java.lang.String = f(g(yay))

</section><section class="slide">

## `andThen`

`andThen` is like `compose`, but calls the first function and then the second, `g(f(x))`

    scala> val fAndThenG = f _ andThen g _
    fAndThenG: (String) => java.lang.String = &lt;function&gt;
    
    scala> fAndThenG("yay")
    res1: java.lang.String = g(f(yay))

</section><section class="slide">

## `case` statements

#### So just what are case statements?

It's a subclass of function called a PartialFunction.

#### What is a collection of multiple case statements?

They are multiple PartialFunctions composed together.

</section><section class="slide">

## Understanding `PartialFunction`

A function works for every argument of the defined type. In other words, a function defined as (Int) => String takes any Int and returns a String.

A Partial Function is only defined for certain values of the defined type.  A Partial Function (Int) => String might not accept every Int.

`isDefinedAt` is a method on PartialFunction that can be used to determine if the PartialFunction will accept a given argument.

__Note__ `PartialFunction` is unrelated to a partially applied function that we talked about earlier.

*See Also* Effective Scala has opinions about [PartialFunction](http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/##Functional%20programming-Partial%20functions).

    scala> val one: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case 1 => "one" }
    one: PartialFunction[Int,String] = &lt;function1&gt;
    
    scala> one.isDefinedAt(1)
    res0: Boolean = true
    
    scala> one.isDefinedAt(2)
    res1: Boolean = false

You can apply a partial function.

    scala> one(1)
    res2: String = one

</section><section class="slide">

## `Partial Functions` (contd)

`PartialFunction` can be composed with something new, called orElse, that reflects whether the PartialFunction is defined over the supplied argument.

    scala> val two: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case 2 => "two" }
    two: PartialFunction[Int,String] = &lt;function1&gt;
    
    scala> val three: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case 3 => "three" }
    three: PartialFunction[Int,String] = &lt;function1&gt;
    
    scala> val wildcard: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case _ => "something else" }
    wildcard: PartialFunction[Int,String] = &lt;function1&gt;
    
    scala> val partial = one orElse two orElse three orElse wildcard
    partial: PartialFunction[Int,String] = &lt;function1&gt;
    
    scala> partial(5)
    res24: String = something else
    
    scala> partial(3)
    res25: String = three
    
    scala> partial(2)
    res26: String = two
    
    scala> partial(1)
    res27: String = one
    
    scala> partial(0)
    res28: String = something else

</section><section class="slide">

## The mystery of `case`

Last week we saw something curious. We saw a case statement used where a function is normally used.

    scala> case class PhoneExt(name: String, ext: Int)
    defined class PhoneExt
    
    scala> val extensions = List(PhoneExt("steve", 100), PhoneExt("robey", 200))
    extensions: List[PhoneExt] = List(PhoneExt(steve,100), PhoneExt(robey,200))
    
    scala> extensions.filter { case PhoneExt(name, extension) => extension < 200 }
    res0: List[PhoneExt] = List(PhoneExt(steve,100))

Why does this work?

`filter` takes a function. In this case a predicate function of `(PhoneExt) => Boolean.`

A `PartialFunction` is a subtype of Function so filter can also take a PartialFunction!

# Types

</section><section class="slide">

## What are static types?  Why are they useful?

According to Pierce: "A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute."

Types allow you to denote function domain & codomains. For example, from mathematics, we are used to seeing:

    f: R -> N

this tells us that function "f" maps values from the set of real numbers to values of the set of natural numbers.

In the abstract, this is exactly what _concrete_ types are.  Type systems give us some more powerful ways to express these sets.

Given these annotations, the compiler can now _statically_ (at compile time) verify that the program is _sound_. That is, compilation will fail if values (at runtime) will not comply to the constraints imposed by the program.

Generally speaking, the typechecker can only guarantee that _unsound_ programs do not compile. It cannot guarantee that every sound program _will_ compile.

With increasing expressiveness in type systems, we can produce more reliable code because it allows us to prove invariants about our program before it even runs (modulo bugs in the types themselves, of course!). Academia is pushing the limits of expressiveness very hard, including value-dependent types!

Note that all type information is removed at compile time. It is no longer needed. This is called erasure.

</section><section class="slide">

## Types in Scala

Scala's powerful type system allows for very rich expression. Some of its chief features are:

* *parametric polymorphism* roughly, generic programming
* *(local) type inference* roughly, why you needn't say `val i: Int = 12: Int`
* *existential quantification* roughly, defining something _for some_ unnamed type
* *views* we'll learn these next week; roughly, "castability" of values of one type to another

</section><section class="slide">

## Scala's Type Hierarchy

* Everything extends from ```Any``` either through ```AnyRef``` or ```AnyVal```
* ```Nothing``` extends from everything (and is the only class that may extend from both ```AnyRef``` and ```AnyVal```)

</section><section class="slide">

## Parametric polymorphism

Polymorphism is used in order to write generic code (for values of different types) without compromising static typing richness.

For example, without parametric polymorphism, a generic list data structure would always look like this (and indeed it did look like this in Java prior to generics):

    scala> 2 :: 1 :: "bar" :: "foo" :: Nil
    res5: List[Any] = List(2, 1, bar, foo)

Now we cannot recover any type information about the individual members.

    scala> res5.head
    res6: Any = 2

And so our application would devolve into a series of casts ("asInstanceOf[]") and we would lack type safety (because these are all dynamic).

Polymorphism is achieved through specifying _type variables_.

    scala> def drop1[A](l: List[A]) = l.tail
    drop1: [A](l: List[A])List[A]
    
    scala> drop1(List(1,2,3))
    res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3)

</section><section class="slide">

## Type inference

A traditional objection to static typing is that it has much syntactic overhead. Scala alleviates this by providing _type inference_. We've seen this already: 

    // Infers that x is of type Int
    val x = 128                   

    // Infers that the return type is Int
    def plusOne(x: Int) = x + 1   

The compiler will teach you which types it can infer and which ones it can't.

</section><section class="slide">

## Type Ascriptions

Sometimes you want the compiler to infer some type in particular (eg. for API compatibility). You can use a type 'ascription' for this:

    val x: Seq[String] = List[String]

</section><section class="slide">

## Variance

Scala's type system has to account for class hierarchies together with polymorphism.  Class hierarchies allow the expression of subtype relationships. A central question that comes up when mixing OO with polymorphism is: if <tt>T'</tt> is a subclass of <tt>T</tt>, is <tt>Container[T']</tt> considered a subclass of <tt>Container[T]</tt>? Variance annotations allow you to express the following relationships between class hierarchies & polymorphic types:

<table>
<tr><td>              </td><td>Meaning                     </td><td> Scala notation</td></tr>
<tr><td>covariant     </td><td>C[T'] is a subclass of C[T]   </td><td> [+T]</td></tr>
<tr><td>contravariant </td><td>C[T] is a subclass of C[T']   </td><td> [-T]</td></tr>
<tr><td>invariant     </td><td>C[T] and C[T'] are not related</td><td> [T]</td></tr>
</table>

The subtype relationship really means: for a given type T, if T' is a subtype, can you substitute it?

</section><section class="slide">

## Covariance

    scala> class Covariant[+A]
    defined class Covariant
    
    scala> val cv: Covariant[AnyRef] = new Covariant[String]
    cv: Covariant[AnyRef] = Covariant@4035acf6
    
    scala> val cv: Covariant[String] = new Covariant[AnyRef]
    &lt;console&gt;:6: error: type mismatch;
     found   : Covariant[AnyRef]
     required: Covariant[String]
           val cv: Covariant[String] = new Covariant[AnyRef]
                                   ^

</section><section class="slide">

## Contravariance

    scala> class Contravariant[-A]
    defined class Contravariant
    
    scala> val cv: Contravariant[String] = new Contravariant[AnyRef]
    cv: Contravariant[AnyRef] = Contravariant@49fa7ba
    
    scala> val fail: Contravariant[AnyRef] = new Contravariant[String]
    &lt;cntraonsole&gt;:6: error: type mismatch;
     found   : Contravariant[String]
     required: Contravariant[AnyRef]
           val fail: Contravariant[AnyRef] = new Contravariant[String]
                                     ^

Contravariance seems strange. When is it used? Somewhat surprising!

    trait Function1 [-T1, +R] extends AnyRef

If you think about this from the point of view of substitution, it makes a lot of sense. Let's first define a simple class hierarchy:

    scala> class Animal { val sound = "rustle" }
    defined class Animal
    
    scala> class Bird extends Animal { override val sound = "call" }
    defined class Bird
    
    scala> class Chicken extends Bird { override val sound = "cluck" }
    defined class Chicken

Suppose you need a function that takes a `Bird` param:

    scala> val getTweet: (Bird => String) = // TODO

The standard animal library has a function that does what you want, but it takes an `Animal` parameter instead.  In most situations, if you say "I need a ___, I have a subclass of ___", you're OK. But function parameters are contravariant. If you need a function that takes a `Bird` and you have a function that takes an `Chicken`, that function would choke on a `Duck`. But a function that takes an `Animal` is OK:

    scala> val getTweet: (Bird => String) = ((a: Animal) => a.sound )
    getTweet: Bird => String = &lt;function1&gt;

A function's return value type is covariant. If you need a function that returns a `Bird` but have a function that returns a `Chicken`, that's great.

    scala> val hatch: (() => Bird) = (() => new Chicken )
    hatch: () => Bird = &lt;function0&gt;

</section><section class="slide">

## Bounds

Scala allows you to restrict polymorphic variables using _bounds_. These bounds express subtype relationships.

    scala> def cacophony[T](things: Seq[T]) = things map (_.sound)
    &lt;console&gt;:7: error: value sound is not a member of type parameter T
           def cacophony[T](things: Seq[T]) = things map (_.sound)
                                                            ^
    
    scala> def biophony[T <: Animal](things: Seq[T]) = things map (_.sound)
    biophony: [T <: Animal](things: Seq[T])Seq[java.lang.String]
    
    scala> biophony(Seq(new Chicken, new Bird))
    res5: Seq[java.lang.String] = List(cluck, call)

Lower type bounds are also supported; they come in handy with contravariance and clever covariance. `List[+T]` is covariant; a list of Birds is a list of Animals. `List` defines an operator `::(elem T)` that returns a new `List` with `elem` prepended. The new `List` has the same type as the original:

    scala> val flock = List(new Bird, new Bird)
    flock: List[Bird] = List(Bird@7e1ec70e, Bird@169ea8d2)
    
    scala> new Chicken :: flock
    res53: List[Bird] = List(Chicken@56fbda05, Bird@7e1ec70e, Bird@169ea8d2)

`List` _also_ defines `::[B >: T](x: B)` which returns a `List[B]`. Notice the `B >: T`. That specifies type `B` as a superclass of `T`. That lets us do the right thing when prepending an `Animal` to a `List[Bird]`:

    scala> new Animal :: flock
    res59: List[Animal] = List(Animal@11f8d3a8, Bird@7e1ec70e, Bird@169ea8d2)

Note that the return type is `Animal`.

</section><section class="slide">

## Quantification

Sometimes you do not care to be able to name a type variable, for example:

    scala> def count[A](l: List[A]) = l.size
    count: [A](List[A])Int

Instead you can use "wildcards":

    scala> def count(l: List[_]) = l.size
    count: (List[_])Int

</section><section class="slide">

## View bounds ("type classes")

Sometimes you don't need to specify that one type is equal/sub/super another, just that you could fake it with conversions. A view bound specifies a type that can be "viewed as" another. This makes sense for an operation that needs to "read" an object but doesn't modify the object.

*Implicit* functions allow automatic conversion. More precisely, they allow on-demand function application when this can help satisfy type inference. e.g.:

    scala> implicit def strToInt(x: String) = x.toInt
    strToInt: (x: String)Int
    
    scala> "123"
    res0: java.lang.String = 123
    
    scala> val y: Int = "123"
    y: Int = 123
    
    scala> math.max("123", 111)
    res1: Int = 123

view bounds, like type bounds demand such a function exists for the given type.  You specify a type bound with `<%` e.g.,

    scala> class Container[A <% Int] { def addIt(x: A) = 123 + x }
    defined class Container

This says that *A* has to be "viewable" as *Int*.  Let's try it.

    scala> (new Container[String]).addIt("123")
    res11: Int = 246
    
    scala> (new Container[Int]).addIt(123) 
    res12: Int = 246
    
    scala> (new Container[Float]).addIt(123.2F)
    &lt;console&gt;:8: error: could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type (Float) => Int
           (new Container[Float]).addIt(123.2)
            ^

</section><section class="slide">

## Other type bounds

Methods can enforce more complex type bounds via implicit parameters. For example, `List` supports `sum` on numeric contents but not on others. Alas, Scala's numeric types don't all share a superclass, so we can't just say `T <: Number`. Instead, to make this work, Scala's math library [defines an implicit `Numeric[T]` for the appropriate types T](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/labs/2011/06/scalas-numeric-type-class-pt-1/).  Then in `List`'s definition uses it:

    sum[B >: A](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B

If you invoke `List(1,2).sum()`, you don't need to pass a _num_ parameter; it's set implicitly. But if you invoke `List("whoop").sum()`, it complains that it couldn't set `num`.

</section><section class="slide">

## Generic programming with views

In the Scala standard library, views are primarily used to implement generic functions over collections.  For example, the "min" function (on *Seq[]*), uses this technique:

    def min[B >: A](implicit cmp: Ordering[B]): A = {
      if (isEmpty)
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("empty.min")
    
      reduceLeft((x, y) => if (cmp.lteq(x, y)) x else y)
    }

Items in the collections aren't required to implement `Ordered`, but `Ordered` uses are still statically type checked.

You can define your own orderings without any additional library support:

    scala> List(1,2,3,4).min
    res0: Int = 1
    
    scala> List(1,2,3,4).min(new Ordering[Int] { def compare(a: Int, b: Int) = b compare a })
    res3: Int = 4

</section><section class="slide">

#### Context bounds & implicitly[]

Scala 2.8 introduced a shorthand for threading through & accessing implicit arguments.

    scala> def foo[A](implicit x: Ordered[A]) {}
    foo: [A](implicit x: Ordered[A])Unit
    
    scala> def foo[A : Ordered] {}                        
    foo: [A](implicit evidence$1: Ordered[A])Unit

Implicit values may be accessed via `implicitly`

    scala> implicitly[Ordering[Int]]
    res37: Ordering[Int] = scala.math.Ordering$Int$@3a9291cf

Combined, these often result in less code, especially when threading through views.

## Structural types

Scala has support for *structural types* -- type requirements are expressed by interface _structure_ instead of a concrete type.

	scala> def foo(x: { def get: Int }) = 123 + x.get
	foo: (x: AnyRef{def get: Int})Int

	scala> foo(new { def get = 10 })                 
	res0: Int = 133

This can be quite nice in many situations, but the implementation uses reflection, so be performance-aware!

## Abstract type members

In a trait, you can leave type members abstract.

	scala> trait Foo { type A; val x: A; def getX: A = x }
	defined trait Foo

	scala> (new Foo { type A = Int; val x = 123 }).getX   
	res3: Int = 123

	scala> (new Foo { type A = String; val x = "hey" }).getX
	res4: java.lang.String = hey

This is often a useful trick when doing dependency injection, etc.

You can refer to an abstract type variable using the hash-operator:

	scala> trait Foo[M[_]] { type t[A] = M[A] }
	defined trait Foo

	scala> val x: Foo[List]##t[Int] = List(1)
	x: List[Int] = List(1)

## Type erasures & manifests

As we know, type information is lost at compile time due to _erasure_. Scala features *Manifests*, allowing us to selectively recover type information. Manifests are provided as an implicit value, generated by the compiler as needed.

	scala> class MakeFoo[A](implicit manifest: Manifest[A]) {
	     |   def make: A = manifest.erasure.newInstance.asInstanceOf[A]
	     | }

	scala> (new MakeFoo[String]).make
	res10: String = ""
